## front-panel USB ports are the root cause of bluescreens which I encountered
My PC has been working flawlessly for a long time.
But bluescreens occur frequently now.
After a few days, I finally found the root cause: front-panel USB.
I suspect that the USB cable or USB port ESD chip is damaged, But I don't have spare time for the checking.
For now, I just rear USB port with a USB HUB attached. Stay away from electrostatic！！！
