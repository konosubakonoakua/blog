# 18 How to better edit long text in issue comment or discussion

When the comment become really long, it's hard to use the webpage markdown editor to edit.

- [ ] via github web markdown editor (may lost, also hard to use)
- [x] copy to local vim buffer, then edit (may lost, less tedious)
  - maybe we can use vim plugin `octo.nvim`
- [ ] sync with repo (persistent, but tedious)
- [ ] anything else
